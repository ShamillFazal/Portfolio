# Portfolio

My goal is to create a high-quality solo React application that covers every step of the process, from design through testing and deployment. I chose a straightforward yet attractive design for the portfolio page I was required to create during the SoC bootcamp because I knew I could develop it in the near future. Now that I've gotten to the stage where I can make more complex pages, my main goal is to take on the satisfying task of launching my very own independent app.

P.S. I will definitely design a portfolio page from scratch in the near future and this is just a first attempt ðŸ˜„.

This is the design I chose from canva and will be attempting to recreate.
(the bio is not mine ðŸ˜…)

## Creating CSS Structure for app ##

After initialising the react application, I went on to create the basic CSS structure of the app as we'd spent the best part of the day doing it for our final 5 week bootcamp projects and the process was all still fresh in my head. Here is the basic structure I managed to create quite quickly from scratch. It does need tweeking a little but I'm happy with it for the short amount of time I had to spare ðŸ˜ƒ.
